# Introduction to Machine Learning
### Workshop at Yale University

### Kevin Anderson, [Yale University](http://psychology.yale.edu/people/kevin-anderson)

----------------------------------------


- This repository contains the materials that will be used during a machine learning workshop at Yale. This workshop will serve as a theoretical and practical introduction to using machine learning methods. It takes a high-level approach, with almost no equations, and offers examples of how to implement these tools using R and synthetic data.

- The materials are all available for free (yay, science!), but please do cite our paper and let me know if you find any of this useful!

- This course assumes some knowledge of statistics (e.g. linear/logistic regression) and programming (i.e. basic R programming, but you will be completely fine if you are fluent in another language like python/MATLAB)

- You will find the following inside this repository:
  - a script for generating some fake data
  - the talk slides
  - a script that we will work through in the workshop


As a reminder:

- You can install the latest version of R for free [here](http://cran.revolutionanalytics.com/)
- And install the latest version of Rstudio for free [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/#Desktop)
